screen_song: 

This screen uses fg colors from:
  arrows+combo+numbers+feedback+lifebar
  105+10+30+60+64 = 269 (13 extra colors)
    -> these spritesheets are merges of classic&modern themes (in the `editables_merge` folder)
  To avoid exceeding the 256 limit, some spritesheets (arrows,numbers,feedback) were reduced by N colors (N < 10):
  98+10+27+57+64 = 256
